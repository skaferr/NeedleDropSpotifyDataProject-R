# Spotify-Data-Poject
This project is ongoing and just for fun. Right now I am working on pulling data from the Spotify API for R, I am currently using the
package spotifyr, but I am working on also using my own code to retreive the data.
in the long-term I am going to determine how to predict how Anthony Fantano is going to rate an album.
