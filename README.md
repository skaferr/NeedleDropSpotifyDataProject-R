# Spotify-Data-Poject
This project is ongoing and just for fun. Right now I am working on pulling data from the Spotify API for R,(using the
package "spotifyr"), but I am working on also using my own code to retreive the data.
Hopefeully, as a result of this work, I am going to be able to predict how Anthony Fantano is going to rate an album.

skills being learned through this: data/web scraping, data structuring, loops, merging data sets, statistical analysis, predictive analysis
