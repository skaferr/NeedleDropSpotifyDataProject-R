Needle drop data
I got the needle drop ratings from this file:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GbGyWVtePH8RZCZd7N3RPDh8m-K6hgO6AyKsAHZpbeQ/edit#gid=0
which was posted by reddit user Opst3r (thank you to them).

I cleaned the data by deleteing albums with no score, and obscure words for rating. 
some of the ratings I could assume numerical ratings:
classic=9
not good=0
solid=6
lukewarm=5
6(66)=6
